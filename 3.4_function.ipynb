    "\n",
    "Assume that you have been tasked to develop a Python function that calculates the effective annual rate (EAR) of return. EAR considers the effect of compounding within the year and can be calculated from the nominal (or stated) annual rate of return (𝑖) using the following formula:\n",

    "EAR = (1 + 𝑖/𝑚)^𝑚 – 1,\n",
